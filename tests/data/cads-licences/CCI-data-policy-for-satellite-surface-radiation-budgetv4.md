**CCI product licence**

**The CCI product is brokered under the terms of the ESA Climate Change Initiative (CCI) Data Policy**

This Data Policy relates to Essential Climate Variable (ECV) data products, with accompanying metadata, produced in the ESA Climate Change Initiative (CCI), by consortia funded fully or partially by the ESA CCI programme. These data are hereafter referred to as "CCI data".

1. General principle: CCI data shall be made freely available without any restrictions on use.

2. Early-release CCI data access may be restricted to project teams only, e.g. during validation and verification phase, but the dataset shall be released to the public no more than 6 months after production.

3. Traceability: information relating to the input data sources, processing chain and error characteristics shall be made available with the data.

4. The responsibility for data management and dissemination during the CCI programme lies with the data producing organisations. They may delegate this task to another organisation if appropriate. (e.g. national data centre, or CCI data facility if this exists).

5. Long-term Stewardship: The responsibility for long-term data management and dissemination (beyond the funding period of the CCI) lies with the data producing organisations, who may hand over the responsibility to another organisation, e.g. a national data centre.

6. CCI data shall be made available to users for free, except for large or complex requests, where a cost for supply may be charged, or if third party licence conditions prevent the onward distribution of the data.

7. CCI data providers may request that users register with the organisation providing the data, in order to track usage of the data.

8. The CCI data products shall be made available under the following terms and conditions of use:

 * a.  All those who use CCI data are required to acknowledge the source of the data as follows: "Data from ESA Climate Change Initiative <ECV> project, <acronym>, are provided via the <data provider name>", for example: "Data from ESA Climate Change Initiative Sea Surface Temperature project, SST CCI, are provided via the Centre for Environmental Data Archival (CEDA)."

 * b.  Intellectual property rights (IPR) in the CCI data lie with the researchers and organisations producing the data, as defined in the contracts with ESA.

 * c.  Liability: ESA gives no warranty as to the quality or the accuracy of the CCI data or its suitability for any use, and shall not be held liable for any damage derived from the use of such data.

9. All input data, auxiliary data and ancillary data used in the production of CCI data shall be retained by the data producing organisation, or their delegated data archival organisation, for a period of at least the duration of the project, to enable reprocessing and investigation of data production issues.

10. To allow CCI datasets to be properly referenced in the scientific literature, it is strongly encouraged to associate DOIs (digital object identifiers) with released datasets, e.g. through national data centres.

The data are provided freely without any restrictions on their use, beyond IPR and acknowledgement considerations summarised below.

The intellectual property rights (IPR) of the Cloud CCI (A)ATSR TCDR remain with the institutions responsible for the production of the data; the UK Science and Technology Facilities Council (RAL Space), University of Oxford and Deutscher Wetterdienst.


**Acknowledgement**

When exploiting ESA CCI data are requested to include the following acknowledgement: "Data from ESA Climate Change Initiative cloud project, Cloud\_CCI, are provided via the Centre for Environment Data Archival (CEDA)".
