ERA5-Land has been produced by replaying the land component of the ECMWF ERA5 climate reanalysis. Reanalysis combines model data with observations from across the world into a globally complete and consistent dataset using the laws of physics. Reanalysis produces data that goes several decades back in time, providing an accurate description of the climate of the past.\n\nERA5-Land provides a consistent view of the water and energy cycles at surface level during several decades.\nIt contains a detailed record from 1950 onwards, with a temporal resolution of 1 hour. The native spatial resolution of the ERA5-Land reanalysis dataset is 9km on a reduced Gaussian grid (TCo1279). The data in the CDS has been regridded to a regular lat-lon grid of 0.1x0.1 degrees.\n\nThe data presented here is a post-processed subset of the full ERA5-Land dataset. Monthly-mean averages have been pre-calculated to facilitate many applications requiring easy and fast access to the data, when sub-monthly fields are not required.\n\nHourly fields can be found in the [ERA5-Land hourly fields CDS page](https://cds-dev.copernicus-climate.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/reanalysis-era5-land?tab=overview "ERA5-Land hourly data"). Documentation can be found in the [online ERA5-Land documentation](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5-Land+data+documentation "ERA5-Land data documentation").\n	\N	resources/reanalysis-era5-land-monthly-means/form.json	resources/reanalysis-era5-land-monthly-means/constraints.json	{"Product type: Reanalysis","Spatial coverage: Global","Temporal coverage: Past","Variable domain: Land (hydrology)","Variable domain: Land (physics)","Variable domain: Land (biosphere)","Provider: Copernicus C3S"}	\N	"{\\"10m u-component of wind\\": {\\"description\\": \\"Eastward component of the 10m wind.

This principle, called data assimilation, is based on the method used by numerical weather prediction centres, where every so many hours (12 hours at ECMWF) a previous forecast is combined with newly available observations in an optimal way to produce a new best estimate of the state of the atmosphere, called analysis, from which an updated, improved forecast is issued. Reanalysis works in the same way, but at reduced resolution to allow for the provision of a dataset spanning back several decades. Reanalysis does not have the constraint of issuing timely forecasts, so there is more time to collect observations, and when going further back in time, to allow for the ingestion of improved versions of the original observations, which all benefit the quality of the reanalysis product.\n\nERA5 provides hourly estimates for a large number of atmospheric, ocean-wave and land-surface quantities.\nAn uncertainty estimate is sampled by an underlying 10-member ensemble\nat three-hourly intervals. Ensemble mean and spread have been pre-computed for convenience.\nSuch uncertainty estimates are closely related to the information content of the available observing system which\nhas evolved considerably over time. They also indicate flow-dependent sensitive areas.\nTo facilitate many climate applications, monthly-mean averages have been pre-calculated too,\nthough monthly means are not available for the ensemble mean and spread.\n\nERA5 is updated daily with a latency of about 5 days. In case that serious flaws are detected in this early release (called ERA5T), this data could be different from the final release 2 to 3 months later. In case that this occurs users are notified.\n\nThe data set presented here is a regridded subset of the full ERA5 data set on native resolution.\nIt is online on spinning disk, which should ensure fast and easy access.\nIt should satisfy the requirements for most common applications.\n\nAn overview of all ERA5 datasets can be found in [this article](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/The+family+of+ERA5+datasets "The family of ERA5 datasets").\nInformation on access to ERA5 data on native resolution is provided in [these guidelines](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/How+to+download+ERA5 "How to download ERA5").\n\nData has been regridded to a regular lat-lon grid of 0.25 degrees for the reanalysis and 0.5 degrees for\nthe uncertainty estimate (0.5 and 1 degree respectively for ocean waves).\nThere are four main sub sets: hourly and monthly products, both on pressure levels (upper air fields) and single levels (atmospheric, ocean-wave and land surface quantities).\n\nThe present entry is "ERA5 hourly data on pressure levels from 1959 to present".\n	\N	resources/reanalysis-era5-pressure-levels/form.json	resources/reanalysis-era5-pressure-levels/constraints.json	{"Variable domain: Atmosphere (surface)","Variable domain: Atmosphere (upper air)","Temporal coverage: Past","Spatial coverage: Global","Product type: Reanalysis","Provider: Copernicus C3S"}	\N	"{\\"Divergence\\": {\\"description\\": \\"This parameter is the horizontal divergence of velocity.

The geopotential height  plays an important role in synoptic meteorology (analysis of weather patterns).  Charts of geopotential height plotted at constant pressure levels (e.g., 300,  500 or 850 hPa) can be used to identify weather systems such as cyclones,  anticyclones, troughs and ridges.\\\\nAt the surface of the Earth, this parameter shows the variations in geopotential  (height) of the surface, and is often referred to as the orography.\\", \\"units\\": \\"m^2 s^-2\\"}, \\"Ozone mass mixing ratio\\": {\\"description\\": \\"This parameter is the mass of ozone per kilogram of air.\\\\nIn the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS), there is a simplified  representation of ozone chemistry (including representation of the chemistry  which has caused the ozone hole).
