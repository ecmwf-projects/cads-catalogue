The geopotential height  plays an important role in synoptic meteorology (analysis of weather patterns).  Charts of geopotential height plotted at constant pressure levels (e.g., 300,  500 or 850 hPa) can be used to identify weather systems such as cyclones,  anticyclones, troughs and ridges.\nAt the surface of the Earth, this parameter shows the variations in geopotential  (height) of the surface, and is often referred to as the orography.",

If we ignore the effects of heating and friction, potential vorticity  is conserved following an air parcel. It is used to look for places where large  wind storms are likely to originate and develop. Potential vorticity increases  strongly above the tropopause and therefore, it can also be used in studies related  to the stratosphere and stratosphere-troposphere exchanges.\nLarge wind storms develop when a column of air in the atmosphere starts to rotate.  Potential vorticity is calculated from the wind, temperature and pressure across a  column of air in the atmosphere. ",

At  temperatures below -23\u00b0C it is calculated for saturation over ice.
