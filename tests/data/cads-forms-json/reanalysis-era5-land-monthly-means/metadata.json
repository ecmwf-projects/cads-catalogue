  "abstract": "ERA5-Land is a reanalysis dataset providing a consistent view of the evolution of land variables over several decades at an enhanced resolution compared to ERA5. ERA5-Land has been produced by replaying the land component of the ECMWF ERA5 climate reanalysis. Reanalysis combines model data with observations from across the world into a globally complete and consistent dataset using the laws of physics. Reanalysis produces data that goes several decades back in time, providing an accurate description of the climate of the past.\n\nERA5-Land provides a consistent view of the water and energy cycles at surface level during several decades.\nIt contains a detailed record from 1950 onwards, with a temporal resolution of 1 hour. The native spatial resolution of the ERA5-Land reanalysis dataset is 9km on a reduced Gaussian grid (TCo1279). The data in the CDS has been regridded to a regular lat-lon grid of 0.1x0.1 degrees.\n\nThe data presented here is a post-processed subset of the full ERA5-Land dataset. Monthly-mean averages have been pre-calculated to facilitate many applications requiring easy and fast access to the data, when sub-monthly fields are not required.\n\nHourly fields can be found in the [ERA5-Land hourly fields CDS page](https://cds-dev.copernicus-climate.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/reanalysis-era5-land?tab=overview \"ERA5-Land hourly data\"). Documentation can be found in the online ERA5-Land documentation (https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/ERA5-Land+data+documentation)",
