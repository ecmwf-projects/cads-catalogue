variables:
    10m u-component of wind:
      description: >-
        This parameter is the eastward component of the 10m wind. It is the horizontal
        speed of air moving towards the east, at a height of ten metres above the
        surface of the Earth, in metres per second.Care should be taken when comparing
        this parameter with observations, because wind observations vary on small
        space and time scales and are affected by the local terrain, vegetation and
        buildings that are represented only on average in the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting
        System.This parameter can be combined with the V component of 10m wind to
        give the speed and direction of the horizontal 10m wind.
      units: m s^-1
    10m v-component of wind:
      description: >-
        This parameter is the northward component of the 10m wind. It is the horizontal
        speed of air moving towards the north, at a height of ten metres above the
        surface of the Earth, in metres per second. Care should be taken when comparing
        this parameter with observations, because wind observations vary on small
        space and time scales and are affected by the local terrain, vegetation and
        buildings that are represented only on average in the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting
        System. This parameter can be combined with the U component of 10m wind to
        give the speed and direction of the horizontal 10m wind.
      units: m s^-1
    2m dewpoint temperature:
      description: >-
        This parameter is the temperature to which the air, at 2 metres above the
        surface of the Earth, would have to be cooled for saturation to occur.It is
        a measure of the humidity of the air. Combined with temperature and pressure,
        it can be used to calculate the relative humidity. 2m dew point temperature
        is calculated by interpolating between the lowest model level and the Earth's
        surface, taking account of the atmospheric conditions. See further information.This
        parameter has units of kelvin (K). Temperature measured in kelvin can be converted
        to degrees Celsius (C) by subtracting 273.15.
      units: K
    2m temperature:
      description: >-
        This parameter is the temperature of air at 2m above the surface of land,
        sea or in-land waters.2m temperature is calculated by interpolating between
        the lowest model level and the Earth's surface, taking account of the atmospheric
        conditions. See further information .This parameter has units of kelvin (K).
        Temperature measured in kelvin can be converted to degrees Celsius (&deg|C)
        by subtracting 273.15.
      units: K
    Evaporation:
      description: >-
        This parameter is the accumulated amount of water that has evaporated from
        the Earth's surface, including a simplified representation of transpiration
        (from vegetation), into vapour in the air above.This parameter is accumulated
        over a particular time period which depends on the data extracted.The ECMWF
        Integrated Forecasting System convention is that downward fluxes are positive.
        Therefore, negative values indicate evaporation and positive values indicate
        condensation.
      units: m of water equivalent
    Evaporation from bare soil:
      description: >-
        The amount of evaporation from bare soil
      units: m of water equivalent
    Evaporation from open water surfaces excluding oceans:
      description: >-
        Amount of evaporation from surface water storage like lakes and inundated
        areas but excluding oceans
      units: m of water equivalent
    Evaporation from the top of canopy:
      description: >-
        The amount of evaporation from the canopy interception reservoir
      units: m of water equivalent
    Evaporation from vegetation transpiration:
      description: >-
        Amount of evaporation from vegetation transpiration. This has the same meaning
        as root extraction i.e. the amount of water extracted from the different soil
        layers
      units: m of water equivalent
    Forecast albedo:
      description: >-
        This parameter is a measure of the reflectivity of the Earth's surface. It
        is the fraction of solar (shortwave) radiation reflected by Earth's surface,
        across the solar spectrum, for both direct and diffuse radiation. Typically,
        snow and ice have high reflectivity with albedo values of 0.8 and above, land
        has intermediate values between about 0.1 and 0.4 and the ocean has low values
        of 0.1 or less. Radiation from the Sun (solar, or shortwave, radiation) is
        partly reflected back to space by clouds and particles in the atmosphere (aerosols)
        and some of it is absorbed. The rest is incident on the Earth's surface, where
        some of it is reflected. The portion that is reflected by the Earth's surface
        depends on the albedo. See further documentation .In the ECMWF Integrated
        Forecasting System (IFS), a climatological background albedo (observed values
        averaged over a period of several years) is used, modified by the model over
        water, ice and snow.Albedo is often shown as a percentage (%).

    Leaf area index, high vegetation:
      description: >-
        Leaf area index high vegetation
      units: m^2 m^-2
    Leaf area index, low vegetation:
      description: >-
      units: m^2 m^-2
    Potential evaporation:
      description: >-
        Potential evaporation in the current ECMWF model is computed, by making a
        second call to the surface energy balance routine with the vegetation parameters
        set to "crops/mixed farming" and assuming no stress from soil moisture.
        In other words, evaporation is computed for agricultural land as if it is
        well watered and assuming that the atmosphere is not affected by this artificial
        surface condition. The latter may not always be realistic. Although pev is
        meant to provide an estimate of irrigation requirements, the method can give
        unrealistic results in arid conditions due to too strong evaporation forced
        by dry air.
      units: m
    Runoff:
      description: >-
        Some water from rainfall, melting snow, or deep in the soil, stays stored
        in the soil. Otherwise, the water drains away, either over the surface (surface
        runoff), or under the ground (sub-surface runoff) and the sum of these two
        is simply called 'runoff'. This parameter is the total amount of water accumulated
        over a particular time period which depends on the data extracted.The units
        of runoff are depth in metres.  This is the depth the water would have if
        it were spread evenly over the grid box. Care should be taken when comparing
        model parameters with observations, because observations are often local to
        a particular point rather than averaged over a grid square area.  Observations
        are also often taken in different units, such as mm/day, rather than the accumulated
        metres produced here.Runoff is a measure of the availability of water in the
        soil, and can, for example, be used as an indicator of drought or flood. More
        information about how runoff is calculated is given in the IFS Physical Processes
        documentation.
      units: m
    Skin reservoir content:
      description: >-
        This parameter is the amount of water in the vegetation canopy and/or in a
        thin layer on the soil.It represents the amount of rain intercepted by foliage,
        and water from dew. The maximum amount of 'skin reservoir content' a grid
        box can hold depends on the type of vegetation, and may be zero.  Water leaves
        the 'skin reservoir' by evaporation. See further information.
      units: m of water equivalent
    Skin temperature:
      description: >-
        This parameter is the temperature of the surface of the Earth. The skin temperature
        is the theoretical temperature that is required to satisfy the surface energy
        balance. It represents the temperature of the uppermost surface layer, which
        has no heat capacity and so can respond instantaneously to changes in surface
        fluxes. Skin temperature is calculated differently over land and sea. This
        parameter has units of kelvin (K). Temperature measured in kelvin can be converted
        to degrees Celsius (C) by subtracting 273.15. See further information
        about the skin temperature over land and over sea.

    Snow albedo:

        Albedo of the snow covered part of the grid box
      units: (0 - 1)
    Snow cover:
      description: >-
      units: '%'
    Snow density:
      description: >-
        This parameter is the mass of snow per cubic metre in the snow layer.The ECMWF
        Integrated Forecast System (IFS) model represents snow as a single additional
        layer over the uppermost soil level. The snow may cover all or part of the
        grid box. See further information on snow in the IFS.
      units: kg m^-3
    Snow depth:
      description: >-
      units: m
    Snow depth water equivalent:
      description: >-
        This parameter is the depth of snow from the snow-covered area of a  grid
        box.Its units are metres of water equivalent, so it is the depth the water
        would have if the snow melted and was spread evenly over the whole grid box.
        The ECMWF Integrated Forecast System represents snow as a single additional
        layer over the uppermost soil level. The snow may cover all or part of the
        grid box. See further information.
      units: m of water equivalent
    Snow evaporation:
      description: >-
        Evaporation from snow averaged over the grid box (to find flux over snow,
        divide by snow fraction). Accumulated field.
      units: m of water equivalent
    Snowfall:
      description: >-
        This parameter is the accumulated total snow that has fallen to the Earth's
        surface.It consists of snow due to the large-scale atmospheric flow (horizontal
        scales greater than around a few hundred metres) and convection where smaller
        scale areas (around 5km to a few hundred kilometres) of warm air rise. If
        snow has melted during the period over which this parameter was accumulated,
        then it will be higher than the snow depth.This parameter is accumulated over
        a particular time period which depends on the data extracted.The units are
        depth in metres of equivalent water. It is the depth the water would have
        if the snow melted and was spread evenly over the grid box.Care should be
        taken when comparing model parameters with observations, because observations
        are often local to a particular point in space and time, rather than representing
        averages over a model grid box and model time step.
      units: m of water equivalent
    Snowmelt:
      description: >-
        Melting of snow averaged over the grid box (to find melt over snow, divide
        by snow fraction). Accumulated field.
      units: m of water equivalent
    Soil temperature level 1:
      description: >-
        This parameter is the temperature of the soil in layer 1 (0 - 7 cm, the surface
        is at 0 cm).The ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System model has a four-layer
        representation of soil: Layer 1: 0 -7cm, layer 2: 7 -21cm, layer 3: 21-72cm, layer
        4: 72-189 cm. Soil temperature is set at the middle of each layer, and heat
        transfer is calculated at the interfaces between them. It is assumed that
        there is no heat transfer out of the bottom of the lowest layer. This parameter
        has units of kelvin (K). Temperature measured in kelvin can be converted to
        degrees Celsius (C) by subtracting 273.15. See further information.
      units: K
    Soil temperature level 2:
      description: >-
        This parameter is the temperature of the soil in layer 2.
      units: K

    Sub-surface runoff:
      description: >-
        Some water from rainfall, melting snow, or deep in the soil, stays stored
        in the soil. Otherwise, the water drains away, either over the surface (surface
        runoff), or under the ground (sub-surface runoff) and the sum of these two
        is simply called 'runoff'. This parameter is the total amount of water accumulated
        over a particular time period which depends on the data extracted.The units
        of runoff are depth in metres.  This is the depth the water would have if
        it were spread evenly over the grid box. Care should be taken when comparing
        model parameters with observations, because observations are often local to
        a particular point rather than averaged over a grid square area.  Observations
        are also often taken in different units, such as mm/day, rather than the accumulated
        metres produced here.Runoff is a measure of the availability of water in the
        soil, and can, for example, be used as an indicator of drought or flood. More
        information about how runoff is calculated is given in the IFS Physical Processes
        documentation.

    Surface latent heat flux:
      description: >-
        Exchange of latent heat with the surface through turbulent diffusion. Accumulated
        field (by model convention, downward fluxes are positive)
      units: J m^-2
    Surface net solar radiation:
      description: >-
        This parameter is the amount of solar radiation (also known as shortwave radiation)
        reaching the surface of the Earth (both direct and diffuse) minus the amount
        reflected by the Earth's surface (which is governed by the albedo).Radiation
        from the Sun (solar, or shortwave, radiation) is partly reflected back to
        space by clouds and particles in the atmosphere (aerosols) and some of it
        is absorbed. The rest is incident on the Earth's surface, where some of it
        is reflected. The difference between downward and reflected solar radiation
        is the surface net solar radiation. See further documentation.This parameter
        is accumulated over a particular time period which depends on the data extracted.
        The units are joules per square metre (J m^-2). To convert to watts per square
        metre (W m^-2), the accumulated values should be divided by the accumulation
        period expressed in seconds.The ECMWF convention for vertical fluxes is positive
        downwards.
      units: J m^-2
    Surface net thermal radiation:
      description: >-
        Net thermal radiation at the surface. Accumulated field (by model convention
        downward fluxes are positive).
      units: J m^-2
    Surface pressure:
      description: >-
        This parameter is the pressure (force per unit area) of the atmosphere on
        the surface of land, sea and in-land water.It is a measure of the weight of
        all the air in a column vertically above the area of the Earth's surface represented
        at a fixed point.Surface pressure is often used in combination with temperature
        to calculate air density.The strong variation of pressure with altitude makes
        it difficult to see the low and high pressure systems over mountainous areas,
        so mean sea level pressure, rather than surface pressure, is normally used
        for this purpose.The units of this parameter are Pascals (Pa). Surface pressure
        is often measured in hPa and sometimes is presented in the old units of millibars,
        mb (1 hPa = 1 mb = 100 Pa).
      units: Pa
    Surface runoff:
      description: >-
        Some water from rainfall, melting snow, or deep in the soil, stays stored
        in the soil. Otherwise, the water drains away, either over the surface (surface
        runoff), or under the ground (sub-surface runoff) and the sum of these two
        is simply called 'runoff'. This parameter is the total amount of water accumulated
        over a particular time period which depends on the data extracted.The units
        of runoff are depth in metres. This is the depth the water would have if
        it were spread evenly over the grid box. Care should be taken when comparing
        model parameters with observations, because observations are often local to
        a particular point rather than averaged over a grid square area. Observations
        are also often taken in different units, such as mm/day, rather than the accumulated
        metres produced here. Runoff is a measure of the availability of water in the
        soil, and can, for example, be used as an indicator of drought or flood.  More
        information about how runoff is calculated is given in the IFS Physical Processes
        documentation.
      units: m
    Surface sensible heat flux:
      description: >-
        This parameter is the transfer of heat between the Earth's surface and the
        atmosphere through the effects of turbulent air motion (but excluding any
        heat transfer resulting from condensation or evaporation).The magnitude of
        the sensible heat flux is governed by the difference in temperature between
        the surface and the overlying atmosphere, wind speed and the surface roughness.
        For example, cold air overlying a warm surface would produce a sensible heat
        flux from the land (or ocean) into the atmosphere. See further documentation
        This is a single level parameter and it is accumulated over a particular time
        period which depends on the data extracted.The units are joules per square
        metre (J m^-2). To convert to watts per square metre (W m^-2), the accumulated
        values should be divided by the accumulation period expressed in seconds.
        The ECMWF convention for vertical fluxes is positive downwards.
      units: J m^-2
    Surface solar radiation downwards:
      description: >-
        This parameter is the amount of solar radiation (also known as shortwave radiation)
        reaching the surface of the Earth. This parameter comprises both direct and
        diffuse solar radiation.Radiation from the Sun (solar, or shortwave, radiation)
        is partly reflected back to space by clouds and particles in the atmosphere
        (aerosols) and some of it is absorbed.  The rest is incident on the Earth's
        surface (represented by this parameter).  See further documentation. To a
        reasonably good approximation, this parameter is the model equivalent of what
        would be measured by a pyranometer (an instrument used for measuring solar
        radiation) at the surface. However, care should be taken when comparing model
        parameters with observations, because observations are often local to a particular
        point in space and time, rather than representing averages over a  model grid
        box and model time step. This parameter is  accumulated over a particular
        time period which depends on the data extracted. The units are joules per
        square metre (J m^-2). To convert to watts per square metre (W m^-2), the accumulated
        values should be divided by the accumulation period expressed in seconds.The
        ECMWF convention for vertical fluxes is positive downwards.
      units: J m-2
    Surface thermal radiation downwards:
      description: >-
        This parameter is the amount of thermal (also known as longwave or terrestrial)
        radiation emitted by the atmosphere and clouds that reaches the Earth's surface.The
        surface of the Earth emits thermal radiation, some of which is absorbed by
        the atmosphere and clouds. The atmosphere and clouds likewise emit thermal
        radiation in all directions, some of which reaches the surface (represented
        by this parameter).  See further documentation. This parameter is accumulated
        over a particular time period which depends on the data extracted. The units
        are joules per square metre (J m^-2). To convert to watts per square metre
        (W m^-2), the accumulated values should be divided by the accumulation period
        expressed in seconds.The ECMWF convention for vertical fluxes is positive
        downwards.
      units: J m-2
    Temperature of snow layer:
      description: >-
        This parameter gives the temperature of the snow layer from the ground to
        the snow-air interface.The ECMWF Integrated Forecast System (IFS) model represents
        snow as a single additional layer over the uppermost soil level. The snow
        may cover all or part of the  grid box. See further information on snow in
        the IFS.This parameter has units of kelvin (K). Temperature measured in kelvin
        can be converted to degrees Celsius (C) by subtracting 273.15.
      units: K
    Total precipitation:
      description: >-
        This parameter is the accumulated liquid and frozen water, including rain
        and snow, that falls to the Earth's surface. It is the sum of large-scale
        precipitation (that precipitation which is generated by large-scale weather
        patterns, such as troughs and cold fronts) and convective precipitation (generated
        by convection which occurs when air at lower levels in the atmosphere is warmer
        and less dense than the air above, so it rises). Precipitation parameters
        do not include fog, dew or the precipitation that evaporates in the atmosphere
        before it lands at the surface of the Earth.This parameter is the total amount
        of water accumulated over a particular time period which depends on the data
        extracted.The units of precipitation are depth in metres.  It is the depth
        the water would have if it were spread evenly over the grid box.Care should
        be taken when comparing model parameters with observations, because observations
        are often local to a particular point in space and time, rather than representing
        averages over a model grid box and  model time step.

        representation of soil: Layer 1: 0 -7 cm, Layer 2: 7 -21 cm, Layer 3: 21-72 cm, Layer
        4: 72-189 cm. The volumetric soil water is associated with the soil texture (or
