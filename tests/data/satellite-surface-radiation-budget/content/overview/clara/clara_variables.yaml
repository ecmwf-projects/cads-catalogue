  descriptor: A number of variables accounting for the uncertainty on the data provided are also included in the files along the main variables. They provide estimates on possible variations of the values of the main variables due to changes in processing and sampling algorithms. A variable containing information about clear-sky condition and target accuracy in each grid cell is also provided.'
