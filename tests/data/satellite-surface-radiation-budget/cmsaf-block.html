  <p>
    The “CLARA product family” refers to EUMETSAT’s CM SAF CLARA-A2 data record (CM SAF cLoud, Albedo and surface RAdiation dataset from AVHRR data - Edition 2).
It merges the AVHRR-sensor data from a variety of satellites into a combined TCDR over several decades.
 It includes the daily means of surface downwelling shortwave flux as well as monthly means of surface downwelling shortwave, surface upwelling longwave, and surface downwelling longwave flux.<p> The monthly means of surface upwelling shortwave, surface net shortwave, surface net longwave and surface net radiative flux are provided by the C3S project, based on the CLARA-A2 data. The surface downwelling shortwave flux ICDR extension is provided by CM SAF; the ICDR’s for all other variables are provided by C3S. </br>

The data record has been validated in peer-reviewed publications in which the uncertainties, limitations and potential applications have been detailed. The data record has sufficient length, consistency, and continuity to detect climate variability and change.
