The “CCI product family” refers to the ESA Cloud_cci version 3.0 surface radiation data record. This record partly comprises 17 years (1995-2012) of radiation and cloud observations from the Along Track Scanning Radiometer (ATSR) series of instruments, flown on board the ESA (European Space Agency) Earth Observation satellites (ERS-2) and Envisat. The ICDR part (January 2017-present) is based on the observations from successor Sea and Land Surface Temperature Radiometer (SLSTR), flown on board the ESA Sentinel 3A and 3B satellites. The dataset provides several different cloud properties, as well as corresponding radiative fluxes which draw on aerosol observations taken from the same instruments. It was produced by RAL (Rutherford Appleton Laboratory) Space under the ESA Climate Change Initiative (CCI) programme. </br>

The data record has been validated in peer-reviewed publications in which the uncertainties, limitations and potential applications have been detailed. The data record has sufficient length, consistency, and continuity to detect climate variability and change.
