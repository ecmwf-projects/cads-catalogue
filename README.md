# cads-catalogue

CADS catalogue manager

## Quick Start

```python
>>> import cads_catalogue

```

## Workflow for developers/contributors

For best experience create a new conda environment (e.g. DEVELOP) with Python 3.10:

```
conda create -n DEVELOP -c conda-forge python=3.10
conda activate DEVELOP
```

Before pushing to GitHub, run the following commands:

1. Update conda environment: `make conda-env-update`
1. Install this package: `pip install -e .`
1. Sync with the latest [template](https://github.com/ecmwf-projects/cookiecutter-conda-package) (optional): `make template-update`
1. Run quality assurance checks: `make qa`
1. Run tests: `make unit-tests`
1. Run the static type checker: `make type-check`
1. Build the documentation (see [Sphinx tutorial](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/tutorial/)): `make docs-build`

### Instructions for database updating

The package `cads-catalogue` comes with its 'catalogue' database.
In case of database structure upgrade, developers must follow these steps:

1. Update the new database structure modifying [/cads_catalogue/database.py](/cads_catalogue/database.py), using
   [SQLAlchemy ORM technologies](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/orm/)
1. Execute from the cads-catalogue work folder:
   ```
   alembic revision -m "message about the db modification"
   ```
1. The last command will create a new python file inside [/alembic/versions](/alembic/versions). Fill the `upgrade`
   function with the operations that must be executed to migrate the database from the old structure to the new one.
   Keep in mind both DDL (structure modification) and DML (data modification) instructions. For reference,
   use https://alembic.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/ops.html#ops.
   Similarly, do the same with the `downgrade` function.
1. Commit and push the modifications and the new file.

For details about the alembic migration tool, see the [Alembic tutorial](https://alembic.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/tutorial.html).
